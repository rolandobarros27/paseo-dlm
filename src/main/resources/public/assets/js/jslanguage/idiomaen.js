            "information": "An extraordinarily beautiful woman, Keraná, lived in the tribe, and she spent her days sleeping. She was Marangatu’s daughter. The evil spirit Tau fell in love with her. He disguised himself as a young man and tried to kidnap her, but Anagatupyry, the spirit of good, intervened to protect her. They fought for seven days and seven nights, until Angatupyry finally defeated Tau, who was exiled by the God of Valor and War Pytajovái, who carried within him the fire of destruction. In the end, Tau kidnaps Keraná. Arasy places a curse on him and as a result Tau and Keraná procreate seven premature and monstrous kids. This is the origin of the myths and legends we know. Yaguarón is considered the cradle of mythology by Narciso R. Colmán, in his paper “Ñande Ypykuéra” he states that Tau and Keraná lived in this city, and that their seven premature and monstrous kids died scorched in the place known as Moñái Kuare, currently known as Itá Potrero."

            "information": "He was Tau and Keraná’s first son. He's a big lizard with the head of a dog, which is where his name comes from, “teju” for lizard and “jagua” for dog. He was by far the ugliest of their kids because of his appearance, however, Tupã didn't allow him the ability to develop his ferocity, therefore he's docile and harmless. According to the myth there are two versions, the first one, in which he walked around aimlessly through Yaguarón’s hill and he was the master of the caves on the hill, where he would take his victims to swallow them up. While in the second version, others claim that he was harmless and that he only ever ate fruits and honey. Some versions of the myth show him with seven dog heads, though the most popular version only mentions one. He is considered the guardian of the riches of all guaraní land."

Another way to attract his victims is the whistle he produces, imitating the song of a bird. He's considered as a guaraní cupid. It's said that Jasy Jateré kidnaps children, feeding them fruits, honey and worms, before letting them go, but once they return to their homes they have already become dumb. Because of this, mothers warn and forbid their kids from going out during nap time, as they are in danger of being taken by Jasy Jateré."
